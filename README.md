## **📌 Task Title: BMI Calculator – (OIBSIP Python Development Task-2)**

### **📋 Objective**

The objective of this task is to build a Python-based **BMI Calculator Application** that allows users to calculate BMI, store their results, and view their BMI history with a visual graph. The application should be user-friendly and demonstrate GUI development, data storage, and data visualization skills.

## **🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** (GUI)
* **SQLite3** (database)
* **Matplotlib** (for graph/chart)
* **Datetime**

## **🚀 Steps Performed**

1. Designed a Tkinter-based interface for user input (username, weight, height).
2. Implemented BMI calculation logic using standard formula.
3. Added height unit options:

   * Meters
   * Centimeters
   * Feet + Inches
4. Added color-coded BMI category display.
5. Stored BMI values into an SQLite database with timestamp and category.
6. Created a **BMI History Viewer** with a Matplotlib graph showing BMI trend over time.
7. Added proper error handling and validation for inputs.

Each category is displayed with a unique color for clarity.
